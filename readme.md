# Sovereign Architecture (BU=S)  
**Backup = Sovereign State. A New Security Model.**

> "To the architect, the foundational equation is \(t_{\text{crypto}} < t_{\text{physical}}\): cryptographic time precedes physical time, enforced by the unforgiving log." [file:20]

## Core Axioms
BU = S: Encrypted volume + audit log = only ground truth
M ≠ S: Movement (network/IO) never equals state
P → 0: Plaintext must be ephemeral only
I = A = E: Intent ≡ Action ≡ Evidence
t_crypto < t_physical: Crypto validation precedes physics

## What Existing Models Get Wrong
| Traditional Security | Sovereign Architecture |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Network = risk surface | Network = sync pipe only |
| Backup ≠ sync | BU = S (one truth) |
| Persistent plaintext | P → 0 (transient only) |
| Monitor flows | Log intent (I=A=E) |
| Air gap = painful | Normative air gap |

## The System
**Three primitives encode the axioms:**
1. **AutoCopier**: Continuous P → E reflection (plaintext → sovereign volume)
2. **Secure Gate**: Manual, audited E → P (human intent required)  
3. **AuditLog**: Immutable confession chain as primary state


## Why This Shatters Current Standards
- **Avalanche effect solved**: Encrypted volumes sync without re-encrypting everything
- **Backup/sync dichotomy dissolved**: BU = S makes them identical
- **Network-centric security obsolete**: M ≠ S kills flow-based monitoring

## Get Involved
- ⭐ Star/watch for alpha release
